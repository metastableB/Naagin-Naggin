# DeepLearning Snake

Create a `virtualenv` and install `Keras` with `Theano` backend. Then install the requirements specified in the `requirements.txt` using pip:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

There is no documentation yet within the code, but it should be easy to follow. For a GUI version of the game simulation, run the following:

    python -m dlsnake.gui_game

Use python3 for all operations, and work from the project root directory.
